# Labels Rename

A small tool made for [Skywind](https://tesrskywind.com/ "Skywind").

> Skywind is a total conversion mod that is remaking the 2002 game The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind in the more modern Skyrim: Special Edition engine.

This tool helps to rename some of the old lines to match them with the new naming scheme.
